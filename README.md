I’m Jett, a 16-year veteran of the Web Development scene. I’m currently looking for the perfect fit with a modern, remote-first company seeking web technology expertise. If you’re reading this, you’re probably looking for a developer with great communication skills, a hawk’s eye for detail, and a self-starter attitude.

I have a deep knowledge of modern javascript frameworks like React and Angular, front-end gold standards for accessibility, excellent UX design, API integration, and CMS management.

My core values around web applications are that they should be beautiful, fast, and fun:

- Beautiful: An app’s functionality is important, but to stand out, it must look good, too. It’s got to be responsive (adapt to every screen size) and gracefully adapt to accessibility aids like screen readers, so all your customers get a good experience, no matter how they access your site.
- Fast: Performance is so important in today’s online marketplace. Bounce rate skyrockets after 3 seconds of load time.([source](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/how-fast-should-a-website-load)) I am an expert in techniques that present your users with the most important parts of your app immediately.

- Fun: Customer engagement through delightful interactions will create brand recognition and make people want to return to your site again and again. This also includes the simple, yet surprisingly rare technique of having every interaction give instant, useful feedback. It’s no fun to use an app that seems to be ignoring your button presses!
